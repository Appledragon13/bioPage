            As I have siad already I am Joel T. Dinovo but most call me JT. I am the 3rd Joel in a row but there is no Jrs or Seniors because we each have different Middle names that set us apart. My Middle name is Thomas, my dad's is Howard, and my grandfather's is Dominic. I am a a very stubborn person and refuses to give up.
