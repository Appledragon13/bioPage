            My main inspiration are my dad as he has always pickednup random things and learned how to do it and because of him I want to try and get into as many things I can. Mark Rober has been my inspiration to follow science of all kinds and to always be creative. I am also just inspired in general by humanity as a whole as when we are determined to do something we do everything we can to accomplish it no matter what.
